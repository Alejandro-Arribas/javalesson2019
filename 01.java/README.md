# Java Programming Language

**Course duration**: 80 double-classes

## Course objective

To teach the student to program in Java. Learn to apply the right
mechanisms and constructions to solve a particular problem.

Upon the completion of the course, the student will be able to:
* understand fundamentals of creating programs using Java;
* create, compile, and debug projects in IDE Eclipse;
* project and implement various algorithms;
* use mechanisms of conditions and loops;
* apply arrays to store data;
* use sorting algorithms and data search;
* understand OOP principles;
* project classes of varying complexity;
* create class hierarchies to solve real world problems;
* use Generics to build template classes;
* throw and handle exceptions;
* choose and use JCF classes;
* save and read information from files;
* understand Java multithreading mechanisms;
* use lambdas;
* use version control system;
* understand basics of teamwork;
* apply projection patterns;
* use unit testing.

Upon completion of this course, the student submits a practical task
and takes a theoretical exam on course materials. For admission to the
examination, all home and practical tasks must be submitted. Practical
task should cover a maximum of material from different sections of the
course.
